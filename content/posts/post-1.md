Cancer remains one of the most significant health challenges worldwide, affecting millions of lives each year. While not all cancers can be prevented, extensive research suggests that a proactive approach to lifestyle, environmental factors, and medical interventions can significantly reduce the risk.

## The Power of a Healthy Lifestyle

### Avoid Tobacco: The Leading Preventable Cause of Cancer
Smoking and tobacco use are responsible for approximately 30% of all cancers and 90% of lung cancers in the U.S. Quitting smoking at any stage reduces the risk, with benefits increasing over time.

### Eat a Nutritious Diet
A balanced diet plays a crucial role in cancer prevention. Focus on:
- Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains
- Healthy fats like olive oil and nuts
- Lean proteins, such as fish and legumes
- Avoiding processed meats and high-calorie foods

### Maintain a Healthy Weight and Stay Active
Obesity is linked to several cancers, including breast, colon, and pancreatic cancer. Regular physical activity reduces inflammation and improves immune function. The CDC recommends:
- **150 minutes of moderate exercise per week** (e.g., brisk walking)
- **75 minutes of vigorous activity per week** (e.g., running)

## Protecting Yourself from Harmful Exposures

### Sun Protection: Your Best Defense Against Skin Cancer
Excessive sun exposure and tanning beds increase the risk of skin cancer. Effective prevention measures include:
- Wearing sunscreen with **SPF 30+**
- Seeking shade between **10 a.m. and 4 p.m.**
- Wearing **protective clothing, sunglasses, and hats**

### Limit Alcohol Consumption
Even moderate alcohol intake is associated with increased risks of breast, colon, liver, and esophageal cancers. Health experts recommend:
- **Zero alcohol for best cancer prevention**
- **Limit to one drink per day for women, two for men (if drinking at all)**

### Safe Sex and Disease Prevention
Certain viruses, such as **HPV and hepatitis B**, are linked to cancers of the cervix, anus, and liver. Protect yourself by:
- Getting vaccinated against **HPV and hepatitis B**
- Practicing **safe sex (using condoms, limiting partners)**

## Medical Interventions: Screenings and Vaccinations

### Get Vaccinated
- **HPV vaccine** prevents nearly all cervical cancers and many genital and head/neck cancers.
- **Hepatitis B vaccine** reduces liver cancer risk in high-risk groups.

### Routine Cancer Screenings
Early detection significantly increases survival rates. Essential screenings include:
- **Mammograms** for breast cancer
- **Colonoscopy** for colorectal cancer
- **Pap tests & HPV tests** for cervical cancer
- **Lung scans** for high-risk smokers
